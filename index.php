<h3> Land Pollution</h3>
<p>Land pollution is the cause of many different factors that ultimately pollute the land. These factors include solid waste, deforestation, chemical, and agricultural activities. Many of these cause a bad affect on the environment.
Solid waste mostly made up of products that are non-biodegradable and these are hard to dispose of.
Deforestation causes the loss of the topmost fertile layer of soil that is essential for the growth of plants and trees. Chemicals are hard in nature and difficult to dispose of. Besides, the solid waste of pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers are either thrown in landfills or at other places. These wastes create another type of land pollution. In addition, agricultural activities use a high amount of chemical products that not only harm the food crop but also the land. Furthermore, these cause other pollution too.</p>

<h3> Water Pollution</h3>
<p>Global pollution is a problem. Pollution can spread to remote areas where no one lives, despite the fact that urban areas are typically more polluted than the countryside. Air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution are the three main categories of pollution. Some contaminated water has a terrible smell, a muddy appearance, and floating trash. Some contaminated water appears clean, but it contains dangerous substances that you can't see or smell.
Together, developed and developing nations must fight to conserve the environment for present and future generations. Today, we dig deep into the subject of Water Pollution. This article can be an introduction to water pollution for kids as we will read many things such as the causes of water pollution further in the article.</p>

<h3> Air Pollution</h3>
<p>Environmental changes are caused by the natural or artificial content of harmful pollutants and can cause instability, disturbance, or adverse effects on the ecosystem. Earth and its environment pose a more serious threat due to the increasing pollution of air, water, and soil. Environmental damage is caused by improper resource management or careless human activities. Therefore, any activity that violates the original nature of the environment and leads to degradation is called pollution. We need to understand the origin of these pollutants and find ways to control pollution. This can also be done by raising awareness of the effects of pollutants.
Air pollution is any physical, chemical, or biological change in the air. A certain percentage of the gas is present in the atmosphere. Increasing or decreasing the composition of these gasses is detrimental to survival. This imbalance in gas composition causes an increase in global temperature which is called global warming.</p>
